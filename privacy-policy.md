Bltnm - Discord Music Bot Privacy Policy (Ramallah Edition)
We at Bltnm, the independent project from Ramallah, attach paramount importance to your data privacy and security. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information related to your use of the Bltnm bot on Discord.

1. Necessary Information Collection
We only collect minimal personal data for the sole purpose of enhancing our service and customizing your music experience.

Server (Guild) Information: Bltnm collects and stores Guild IDs and Guild settings (such as customization preferences) to optimize performance and deliver an ideal experience.

Custom Playlists (Personal Playlists): When a user creates a personal playlist, we store their Discord ID and the playlist content. This is the maximum extent of personal data we collect.

2. Exclusive Data Usage Principle
We adhere to the principle of using collected data strictly for its stated purpose, without secondary or extraneous use.

Server Data Use: Collected Guild settings and IDs are used exclusively to tailor Bltnmâ€™s features and meet the specific needs of your server. This information is never shared or used for any purpose beyond enhancing the bot's functionality.

Playlist Data Use: User data associated with custom playlists is used only to manage and provide the personalized musical content created by the user. This information is not shared or used for any other purpose whatsoever.

3. Commitment to Security and Transparency
Data Security: Bltnm is committed to implementing the highest industry standards for security and protection to safeguard your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Data integrity is a top priority for us as an independent entity.

Third-Party Integration: Bltnm does not share any of your information with third parties or external entities. We ensure your privacy remains at the forefront of our operations.

4. Data Retention and Deletion Policy
Server Data Retention: Server IDs and settings are retained only as long as the bot is providing service. This data is automatically deleted if the bot is kicked from the server (after a maximum retention period of one week from the kick date).

Playlist Data Retention: Playlist data is retained as long as the playlist remains active. If a user deletes their personal playlist, the associated data will be permanently and unrecoverably removed.

5. Updates
The Bltnm team reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy to reflect operational or legal changes. Users will be notified of any significant changes through our official communication channels, as specified in the Conditions of Use.
